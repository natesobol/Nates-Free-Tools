# Monetize Hub Starter

A starter website for hosting webapps with monetization in mind. It provides a home page, about page, navigation menu, and a robust login/account system backed by SQLite.

## Static preview
- View the static landing page on GitHub Pages: https://natesobol.github.io/Nates-Free-Tools/
- The preview uses `index.html` plus companion static pages in the root and `/apps/` folders
- Static versions of webapps are available at:
  - Excel to JSON: `/apps/excel-to-json/index.html`
  - JSON Combiner: `/apps/json-combiner/wwwroot/index.html`
- Dynamic features (login, admin, server-backed Excel conversion) require running the Node.js server locally or on a host that supports server-side rendering.

## Features
- Home and About pages with modern UI and navigation menu
- Registration and login with hashed passwords and persistent sessions
- Account dashboard for updating profile, subscription plan, and marketing preferences
- Admin-only dashboard for reviewing all accounts (seeded with `admin@example.com` / `admin` — change immediately)
- Excel-to-JSON converter webapp with upload, preview, and JSON download
- SQLite database for user data and session storage
- EJS templating with responsive styling

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy the environment template and update secrets as needed:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the site.

## Webapps

### Excel to JSON Converter
Located in `apps/excel-to-json/`, this webapp converts Excel spreadsheets to JSON format.

- Preview JSON output with multi-sheet support
- Download converted JSON files
- Server-side processing via Express routes
- Static HTML version for GitHub Pages

**Server Route:** `/excel-to-json`  
**Static Version:** `/apps/excel-to-json/index.html`

### JSON Combiner
Located in `apps/json-combiner/`, this C# .NET minimal API webapp combines multiple JSON files.

**Features:**
- Upload multiple JSON files
- Arrays are concatenated
- Objects are deep-merged
- Mixed types are wrapped into a single array
- Standalone web UI

**Run locally:**

## Tech Stack
- Node.js + Express (main application)
- SQLite for data and session storage
- EJS for server-rendered views
- Helmet and secure session defaults for baseline security
- C# .NET (JSON Combiner webapp)

## Notes
- User passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes
- Profile updates persist to the database and refresh the session payload
- Replace placeholder links in the footer and pricing sections with production resources when ready
- Old `/excel-to-json.html` in root redirects to new location for backwards compatibility
