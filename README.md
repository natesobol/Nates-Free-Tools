# Monetize Hub Starter

A starter website for hosting webapps with monetization in mind. It provides a home page, about page, navigation menu, and a robust login/account system backed by SQLite.

## Static preview
- View the static landing page on GitHub Pages: https://natesobol.github.io/Nates-Free-Tools/
- The preview uses `index.html` plus companion static pages (`about.html`, `excel-to-json.html`, `login.html`, `register.html`, `admin.html`) so navigation works on GitHub Pages.
- Dynamic features (login, admin, Excel → JSON downloads) require running the Node.js server locally or on a host that supports server-side rendering.
- The preview uses `index.html` alongside the assets in `public/` so you see the home experience instead of the repository README.
- Dynamic features (login, admin, Excel → JSON) require running the Node.js server locally or on a host that supports server-side rendering.

## Features
- Home and About pages with modern UI and navigation menu
- Registration and login with hashed passwords and persistent sessions
- Account dashboard for updating profile, subscription plan, and marketing preferences
- Admin-only dashboard for reviewing all accounts (seeded with `admin@example.com` / `admin` — change immediately)
- Excel-to-JSON converter webapp with upload, preview, and JSON download
- SQLite database for user data and session storage
- EJS templating with responsive styling

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy the environment template and update secrets as needed:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the site.

## Excel to JSON converter
- Navigate to `/excel-to-json` from the top navigation or hero CTA.
- Upload `.xls` or `.xlsx` files up to 5 MB for in-memory conversion.
- Preview the JSON payload per worksheet and download a ready-to-use `.json` file.

## Tech stack
- Node.js + Express
- SQLite for data and session storage
- EJS for server-rendered views
- Helmet and secure session defaults for baseline security

## Notes
- User passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes.
- Profile updates persist to the database and refresh the session payload.
- Replace placeholder links in the footer and pricing sections with production resources when ready.
