# CSV/XML Data Converter

This webapp converts CSV to well-formed XML and XML back to CSV on the fly. It is inspired by Sobolsoft's CSV To XML Converter and packaged for Monetize Hub so you can drop it alongside other tools.

## Endpoints
- `GET /csv-xml-converter` - render the converter UI
- `POST /csv-xml-converter` - handle conversion (CSV → XML or XML → CSV)
- `POST /csv-xml-converter/download` - download the converted payload

## Features
- Paste data directly or upload CSV/XML files up to 2 MB
- CSV parsing with header detection and whitespace trimming
- XML parsing that searches for repeating `<row>` or `<record>` elements and flattens nested values
- In-memory processing only—no files are written to disk

## Running locally
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the server: `npm run dev`
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000/csv-xml-converter`
